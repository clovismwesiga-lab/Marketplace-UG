        <p>
            Marketplace UG is a fast-growing online platform where Ugandans can buy, sell, and connect 
            with ease. We were created to give everyone — from Kampala to Gulu, Mbarara to Arua — a 
            simple, reliable, and affordable way to trade goods and services.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            To empower Ugandans by providing a transparent, secure, and easy-to-use marketplace that 
            supports individuals, businesses, and local communities.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            To become Uganda’s number one home-grown marketplace — connecting millions of buyers and 
            sellers every day and supporting the growth of local entrepreneurship.
        </p>

            digital movement. Marketplace UG is here to support small businesses, youth entrepreneurs, 
            boda riders, farmers, students, startups, and everyday Ugandans looking for trusted
